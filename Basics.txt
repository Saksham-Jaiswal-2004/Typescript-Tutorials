Typescript is a better version of Javascript
It has more features than Javascript
Some features are missing in Javascript
There is no Type Safety (Interchangeable data type for a variable) in Javascript

TypeScript Setup
•Setting up a TypeScript Project
•Configuring tsconfig.json --> "tsc --init" if error comes then use "npx tsc --init"
•Compiling TypeScript

Every valid JavaScript code is a valid TypeScript code

run "tsc --watch" if you want that the typescript files keeps compiling as soon as the file is saved it 
without running another command.

Basic Types:
•Primitive Types (number, string, boolean)
•Reference Types
    •Arrays
    •Tuples
    •Enums
•Any, Unknown, Void, Null, Undefined, Never

We can copy primitive data types directly whereas we cannot directly copt reference data types
