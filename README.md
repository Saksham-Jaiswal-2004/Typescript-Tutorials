# 📘 TypeScript & React with TypeScript (TSX) Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal learning repository where I explore and practice **TypeScript** and **React with TypeScript (TSX)**. This repository is organized into separate folders for **TypeScript** and **TypeScript with React (TSX)** tutorials, including mini-projects to reinforce the concepts.

---bash

## 📂 Folder Structure

typescript-tutorials/
│
├── typescript-tutorials/ → Core TypeScript (TS) practice files
├── ts-react-tutorials/ → TypeScript with React (TSX) tutorials
├── tsconfig.json → Global TS config (can be per project too)
├── package.json → (Optional) Common dependencies for projects
└── README.md → This file you're reading

---

### 🔹 `typescript-tutorials/`
This folder contains **TypeScript** tutorials, with individual folders for each topic. Here are the key concepts covered:
- **Variables, Functions, and Types**
- **Advanced Types:** Union, Intersection, Type Narrowing
- **Interfaces, Classes, and Generics**
- **Utility Types and Modules**
- **Practice Projects** such as a simple Calculator or Todo App

Each file includes:
- **`.ts`** source code
- **`.js`** output after compilation (generated using `tsc`)

### 🔷 `ts-react-tutorials/`
This section focuses on using **TypeScript with React (TSX)**, with mini-projects for each concept. Key concepts include:
- **Components, Props, and State**
- **Custom Hooks & Built-in Hooks with TS**
- **API Fetching with Typed Responses**
- **Context API with Type Safety**
- **Forms with Type Validation**
- **Projects** such as a Todo App or API-based User List

Each folder here contains:
- **App.tsx** — main component file
- **Components/`ComponentName`.tsx** — reusable components
- **Types/`TypeName`.ts** — TypeScript type definitions
- **Styles/`style.css`** — styling files (if any)

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

### 1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Typescript-Tutorials.git
cd Typescript-Tutorials
---

### 2. Install dependencies (for React/Vite projects)
If you're running React projects (e.g., in ts-react-tutorials/), install the required dependencies:
---bash
npm install
---

### 3. Compile TypeScript files
For TypeScript practice files (in typescript-tutorials/), compile .ts files into .js:

---bash
npx tsc
---
The compiled JavaScript files will appear next to their TypeScript counterparts. For example, App.tsx will compile to App.js.

### 4. Run React projects
Navigate into any folder under ts-react-tutorials/ and run the React project:

---bash
npm run dev   # For Vite or other dev server configurations
---
This will start a development server and open the React app in your browser.

## 🛠 Tools & Stack
TypeScript – Superset of JavaScript for static typing

React – JavaScript library for building user interfaces

Vite – Next-generation, fast development tool

Node.js – JavaScript runtime (used for compiling TypeScript files and running dev servers)

## 📌 Notes
Each tutorial folder includes a README explaining the specific concepts and how to run the code.

Feel free to fork this repo, clone it, and modify the code to experiment.
