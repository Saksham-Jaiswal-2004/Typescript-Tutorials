Interfaces and Type Aliases
• Defining Interfaces
• Using Interfaces to defining object shapes
• Extending Interfaces
• Type Aliases
• Intersection Types

Interface ka kaam hai object ka shape batana
Types ka kaam hai apne khud ke user defined types banana

Both Interfaces and Types are almoest same but they have some key differences:
1. As two interfaces with same name gets merged this does not apply to types
2. Types = works with data types and define them, Interfaces = Shapes an object
